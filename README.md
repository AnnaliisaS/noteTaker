# noteTaker
An app that allows users to write and save notes to better organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks that need to be completed. When notes are taken properly, this allows for users to keep track of more information, without forgetting or being unable to recall important, pertinent information. The application also allows for users to delete notes when they are no longer necessary or needed.
